# What is this "game" exactly?

Pepega Catch is a browser extension that inserts Pepegas in the webpages that you visit.

Simply click a Pepega to catch it.

Your Pepega Army (Pepegas you've already caught) will then "battle" the Wild Pepega that you're trying to catch.
Pepegas in your army can die during battle, and if you and all your Pepegas fail to defeat the Wild Pepega, it will escape.
This all happens automatically, however, so all you have to do is click on the Wild Pepega!

When you successfully catch a Wild Pepega, it will automatically be enlisted in your army.

Pepegas in your army generate IQ Points. You can spend IQ Points to expand your army, and ressurect dead Pepegas who died in battle!

You'll also be ranked based on how much IQ you have. The higher your rank is, the more powerful you become!
This means being able to win battles against much stronger Pepegas!

## Natural Habitats

Pepegas have a "natural habitat" based on their type, and those habitats are the websites that you visit!

This means you'll be able to find more Pepegas of a particular type that is related to the website that you're on.

For example, you'll find more Weebgas in anime websites, more Kappagas on Twitch, more 200 IQ Pepegas on "how-to" websites and search engines, and so on...

## Leveling Up Pepegas

Pepegas can level up by combining it with two other Pepegas of the same type and level.

For example, three Level 1 Pepegas will combine into a Level 2 Pepega, and three Level 2 Pepegas will combine into a Level 3 Pepega.

The highest level for a Pepega is Level 3.

## Pepega Fusions

You can fuse certain Pepegas to make a more powerful, more intelligent Pepega of a different but related type.

For example, you can make a 400 IQ Pepega by fusing two 200 IQ Pepegas, and you can make a Forsenga by fusing one Maldga and two Kappagas.

The Pepegas, however, must be Level 3 in order for them to be able to fuse with other Pepegas.


# Filtering Sites and Disabling Spawns

The game allows you to easily filter sites where you don't want Pepegas to spawn.

You may also completely disable the spawning of all Pepegas on all sites but still have the game running,
so that Pepegas you've already caught will still generate IQ but you won't be bothered by Pepega spawns anymore!


# Issues

The game is still in beta so the balance won't be 100% perfect yet, and there might be a couple of bugs here and there, so I'd love to hear your feedback if you have any!
